# KiCadFiles
This is a repository of KiCad files for various retro gaming systems and related accessories. Unless otherwise noted, all files in this repository are licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license. Attribution is required on commercial products. You can obtain an attribution exemption by making a small one-time donation; see below for details.

## Symbols & Footprints
Symbols and footprints in this repository are used in our other projects. You can use them in your projects too!

## PCBs
Most PCBs are not intended to be complete projects but rather templates you can use to start a project.

# Using In Your Products/Projects

## Attribution
You can give attribution in several ways. If a project is just for you, don't worry about it: just don't touch the existing notices. If you are releasing it either in source or physical form (or both), you should use one of the recommended attribution methods listed below. **Under no circumstances should your attribution notice attempt to make it sound like you or your product is endorsed by StarshadeRETRO.**

### Source Form
If your project is only being released in source form, leaving the copyright and license notice untouched is enough.

### Physical Form
If your project is being released/sold, then it depends on what was used:

#### Footprint/Symbols
You need only make a mention in the product listing page, either in the main features section or a "details" section. The attribution can be as simple as:
> Uses [SYSTEM NAME] footprints/symbols from StarshadeRETRO.

If your device uses more than 1 of our symbols/footprints, then you can generalize it:
> Uses various footprints/symbols from StarshadeRETRO.

In all cases, "StarshadeRETRO" should be a link to this GitHub repository.

You do not need to put credit on the physical device. If you want to, you can use the same notice.

#### PCBs
If you are using a blank PCB template (no components placed other than one of our footprints/symbols), then you can follow the same guidelines as for footprint/symbols and add a reference to the PCB template instead:

> Uses [SYSTEM NAME] PCB template from StarshadeRETRO.

Again, "StarshadeRETRO" should be a link to this GitHub repository.

If you are using a PCB template that includes components and:
- are only selling a PCB (no housing): Leaving in the existing silkscreen notice is sufficient. You can move it around as needed as long as it remains legible. It can be on the front or back.
- are selling a device with opaque housing: You should add a mention to the product page as mentioned above, *and* have a similar notice somewhere on your product or product documentation/packaging.

You can treat translucent housing as a PCB without housing if it is transparent enough that anyone can easily read the notice on the PCB.

### Attribution Exemption
If you want permission to omit attribution on a commercial product, you can contact us. The fee to obtain permission to omit attribution is a simple one-time donation of $100 per product/device. There are no royalties or volume-based pricing, nor does it matter how many symbols or footprints are used in the product. It also follows all revisions and sub-models of that product (i.e., if you made a flash cart, then made another flash cart with more/less/different memory, it would be considered the same product). You must contact us first before donating. Previous donations cannot be used towards attribution omission.

### Attribution Acknowledgement
If your project/product uses or is based on something from this repository, you can contact us to request to be listed in an upcoming "Used by/in" list. Please note that acknowledgment is not an endorsement.

## Donations
All donations made directly to the project, including those to omit attribution, go towards furthering this and other projects. They are used to purchase equipment, components, etc. If you want your donation to go towards something specific, you can contact us before making it so we can ensure that it happens. Contributions for attribution removal can be made with such a request, though the scope of what a donation can be towards will be narrower. We can provide proof that your donation went towards your desired goal if it is possible/practical.
