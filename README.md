# KiCadFiles
This is a repository of KiCad files for various retro gaming systems and related accessories. Unless otherwise noted, all files in this repository are licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license.

When selling physical products based on the files within this repository, attribution via a text link within the product's listing that leads to this repository as well as a text-based notice indicating the URL of this project and what was used in any included documentation or manuals is considered sufficient for fulfilling the license. If you intend to sell the PCBs be sure to remove the Starshade logo first -- see the section on the logo below for more details. Attribution should not be made in a way that suggests affiliation, endorsement, etc.

## Symbols & Footprints
Symbols and footprints in this repository are used in our other projects. You can use them in your projects too!

## PCBs
This repository contains a mix of finished, working, and work-in-progress PCBs as well as PCBs that are not intended to be used as-is but rather as templates you can use to start a project with accurate dimensions that will fit into the OEM location.

## The Starshade Logo
The Starshade logo is used many times throughout this repository, however, it is ***not*** included as part of the project's open license. You *may **not*** use the logo outside of this repository without permission. You **must** remove the logo from products you produce for commercial purposes (i.e. resale, promotion, etc). The logo can be left as is when having PCBs produced for personal use (limit of 5 PCBs per type/revision).

Other than not being able to use Starshade logo there are no further restrictions on commercial use. After removing the logo there are no limits on use, production run size, etc. Removal of the logo is primarily to avoid confusion about who produced/provided the PCB.

## Donations
All donations made to the project go towards furthering this and other projects. They are used to purchase equipment, components, etc. If you want your donation to go towards something specific, you can contact us before making it so we can ensure that it happens. We can provide proof that your donation went towards your desired goal if it is possible/practical.

## Store
Profit from purchases made from the [StarshadeRETRO store](https://store.starshade.dev/) goes towards furthering the development of various projects, including this one, the same as donations do. The only difference is you get something in return when you buy from the store. This is generally preferred over a direct contribution so that you get something in return.
