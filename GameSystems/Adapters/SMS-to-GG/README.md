# SMS-to-GG Adapter
Converts a Master System slot to Game Gear for dumping cartridges. Intended for use with the [OSCR HW5](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader).

If getting this made, use a 1.6mm or 1.4mm PCB thickness. 1.6mm is a little tight but is recommended. It keeps the adapter more stable when inserting and removing GG cartridges. 1.4mm will fit a little easier but will wobble a bit when inserting and removing cartridges. While most SMS games seem to be 1.55mm, some SMS games are 1.7mm, so while 1.6mm is a bit tight it's not unrealistic for the system.

You can purchase this adapter [from our store](https://store.starshade.dev/en-gb/product/oscr-and-accessories/oscr-accessories/oscr-adapter-game-gear).
